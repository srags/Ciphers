# caesar-cipher-encryption

#Every letter in the alphabet is assigned a number, in order, starting at 0. This means that a is assigned 0, b is assigned 1, z is assigned 25, . is assigned 26, and so on.

#You are given a text to encrypt, for instance a string, and another symbol in the alphabet A, for instance a letter c, that serves as the encryption key. By converting the key character to its assigned number, the caesar cipher works by adding the  key to each character.
